## Checklist

CI already gates build/lint/format/typecheck/coverage/mutation — no need to re-check those here.

- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated, if this changes API behavior, config format, or anything else a deployer/caller would need to know about
- [ ] `context.md` updated, if this changes a convention, gotcha, or architectural rule an agent working in this repo would need to know
- [ ] `DECISIONS.md` updated, if this changes or reverses a prior recorded decision
- [ ] New tests are in `test/unit/` if every collaborator is faked, `test/integration/` if real production classes are wired together
